# weather-forecast

## Description
Hello, Here you will find a weather dashboard that allows you to search any city and display its current temperature, humidity, wind-speed, and uv index. Right below it, you can access a 5-day weather forecast of the city you have searched. These weather icons will display the date, temperature, humidity, and an icon that matches the current weather for that day.
